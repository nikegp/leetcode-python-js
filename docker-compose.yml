      # bind-mounting these two files in will let you add packages during development without rebuilding
      # for example, to add bower to your app while developing, just install it inside the container
      # and then nodemon will restart. Your changes will last until you "docker compose down" and will
      # be saved on host for next build.
      # remember to install from the parent directory to the code bind-mount:
      # docker compose exec -w /opt/node_app node npm install --save bower
      - ./node/package.json:/opt/node_app/package.json
      - ./node/package-lock.json:/opt/node_app/package-lock.json
      # this is a workaround to prevent host node_modules from accidently getting mounted in container
      # in case you want to use node/npm both outside container for test/lint etc. and also inside container
      # this will overwrite the default node_modules dir in container so it won't conflict with our
      # /opt/node_app/node_modules location. Thanks to PR from @brnluiz
